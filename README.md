## OVERVIEW 

In Sky vs. Sea, you and your fellow will play against each other taking the role of Eagle or Shark. 

The goal of this game is to terminate the offspring (Baby piece) of the enemy's team. Whoever can do it first will be declared as the winner of the game. 

## SETUP 

At the start of the game, each player will have your pieces on the opposite side of each other on the board, with at least a piece of each character type and only one Baby piece.

**ACTIONS**

Players will take turn to make your moves.

**MOVING**

In each turn a player will pick a piece of your own and move it to any possible tiles that are indicated by the highlighted color on the board.

**ATTACK**

After moving to a new tile (or stay in the same tile), you can choose either Killing or Performing special effect.

Killing will allow you to terminate an enemy piece that is on a lower hierarchy than you

Performing special effect will allow you to cast your special power on either your or enemy's piece depending on the nature of your piece's power.

These attacks will also be limited the attack range of each pieces.

**END YOUR TURN**

After you finished your attack, it will now be the other player's turn to make their moves 

Note: You can also use Skip to end your turn without attacking
